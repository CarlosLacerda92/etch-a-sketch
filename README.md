# etch-a-sketch

Project: Etch-a-Sketch | The Odin Project

This repository contains the code to the Etch-a-Sketch project from the Foundations Course of The Odin Project.

The goal here is to put into practice all concepts learned until now, specifically those in the JavaScript Basics section: from variables and operators to DOM manipulation and events.

It's a grid that may be created by the user, who'll inform how many cells each side of the grid is going to have through a prompt box (e.g., 10 means it'll be a 10x10 grid, so, 100 cells). Then, whenever a grid cell is hovered over by the mouse, it'll be painted with a random color and its opacity will increase by 10% each time the user hovers over that same cell with the mouse, until it becomes fully opaque.
